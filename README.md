# Hangar - Paper's Plugin Repository

This is the repository for Hangar, a plugin repository used for Paper, Velocity, and Waterfall plugins and similar software.

Hangar is loosely based off of [Ore](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Ore), created by the Sponge project, but rebuilt from the ground up using the Spring Boot
Framework in Java for the backend and Nuxt (with UnoCSS) for the frontend. We would like to thank all Ore contributors. Without them, this project would never
have been possible.

On top of our production instance at https://hangar.papermc.io/, we have a staging instance for testing purposes: https://hangar.papermc.dev/.

## Contributing

The project consists of 3 main parts

* Frontend (Vue.js under Nuxt with UnoCSS)
* Backend (Spring Boot)
* Database (PostgreSQL)

## Development Setup

Fork the project and pull it in your IDE.

### Prerequisites

* Docker is required in order to run the PostgreSQL database and the dummy email server
* Java 17 or higher
* [pnpm]
* mvn
* git

### Setting up

To get the project running locally, you need to follow a few steps:

1. Get the dummy database, storage and email server up and running. Move to the docker folder `cd docker` then run `docker-compose -f dev.yml up -d` (`-d` as an optional parameter
   to run the containers in the background).
   Alternatively, if you are using IntelliJ you can press the green arrow in the `docker/dev.yml` file.
2. Move to the `backend` directory: `cd ../backend`. In that directory, run `mvn spring-boot:run`, or if you're using IntelliJ, it is included in the run
   configurations.
3. Move to the `frontend` directory: `cd ../frontend`. In that directory, run `pnpm install`. This will install all the needed Node modules.
4. After the installation, run `pnpm run dev` in the frontend directory to initiate the build and launch. Changes you do to the frontend will be reloaded
   automatically.
5. After that, open http://localhost:3333, and if all went well, Hangar should be up and running.

### Notes

* The Spring Boot configuration file that is used by this environment is located at `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml`.
* You can view the emails hangar sends on http://localhost:4436/
* On staging/prod Hangar uses object storage, if you want to test that you can install minio and change the storage type to `object` in the `application.yml`

## Deployment

Deployment happens via a helm chart in the `/chart` folder. The Spring Boot configuration file used for deployment can be found at
`chart/templates/secret-hangar-backend.yaml` (however it will be overridden with the actual values via helm).

## Translations [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/e/b13e6a1c05002365ee9031712112bd63/localized.svg)](https://hangar.crowdin.com/hangar)

Hangar uses Crowdin for translations. If you want to contribute to translations, create a Crowdin account at https://hangar.crowdin.com/hangar and simply add
new translations or comment/vote on existing translations. You can learn more about navigating the Crowdin UI here: https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/.

#### Getting translations locally (mostly for developers, requires Crowdin CLI, ran in root folder):

`crowdin pull --skip-untranslated-strings -b master -T <PAT>`

You might want to set the env var `TRANSLATION_MODE` to true in order to get warnings about untranslated strings.

## Contributing

Most of our current and future plans can be found in the [**Hangar Roadmap Project**](https://github.com/PaperMC/Hangar/projects/1). Your best bet is joining
the #development channel on the [Hangar Discord](https://discord.gg/zvrAEbvJ4a) to start discussing potential contributions and ideas. With Hangar being such a
massive project, any contributions are welcome!

Updating the frontend dependencies can be done best by running `npx npm-check -u` and going through the changelogs. Note that package.json might contain hints
to which dependencies are broken.

## Tracing

If you want to have traces available locally, you can run zipkin via the docker-compose file `zipkin.yml` in the docker folder like this:

```shell
cd docker
docker-compose -f zipkin.yml up -d
```

Then just enable it in the `application.yml` under `management.tracing`.
You also need to comment in the dependency in the pom.xml
