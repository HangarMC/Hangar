# Hangar - Papers upcoming Plugin Repository

This is the repository for Hangar, a plugin repository used for Paper plugins and similar software.

Hangar is loosely based off of [Ore](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Ore), created by the Sponge project,
but rebuilt from the ground up using the Spring Boot Framework in Java for the backend and nuxt (and vuetify) for the frontend (which is partially server rendered).
We would like to thank all Ore contributors. Without them, this project would never have been possible.

There may or may not be a staging instance running at https://hangar.benndorf.dev
It may or may not allow you to log in, please don't create too much of a mess so that I don't always need to nuke the DB when I want to use it.

## Contributing
The project consists out of 4 parts
* Frontend (written in Vue vite-ssr via [vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse))
* Backend (Spring Boot)
* Database (PostgreSQL)
* User Management ([HangarAuth]; optional, see below)

There are two different environments that can be developed in, one using a fake user (aka without [HangarAuth]), or with [HangarAuth].
Most of the time you won't need to run Hangar with [HangarAuth] unless you are working with a feature that requires multiple user interactions.

## Fake User environment (recommended, easy, no [HangarAuth])

Fork the project and pull it in your IDE.
### Prerequisites

* Docker is required in order to run the PostgreSQL database.
* Java 17 or higher.
* [pnpm]
* git
### Setting up
To get the project running locally, you need to follow a few steps:
1. Run `git submodule update --init` to initialize the [HangarLib](https://github.com/HangarMC/HangarLib) submodule. If you want to commit code to the lib repository (found in `frontend/src/lib`) without cloning the repo separately, you also need to checkout a branch using `cd frontend/src/lib && git switch master`.
2. To get the dummy database up and running, move to the docker folder `cd docker` then run `docker-compose -f dev-db.yml up -d` (`-d` as an optional parameter to run the containers in the background).
   Alternatively, if you are using IntelliJ you can press the green arrow in the `docker/dev-db.yml` file.
3. Run the Spring Boot application. You can do it in the CLI with `mvn spring-boot:run` or if you're using IntelliJ, it's included in the run configurations.
4. Move to the `frontend` directory: `cd ../frontend`. In that directory, run `pnpm install`. This will install all the needed Node modules.
5. After the installation, run `pnpm run dev` in the frontend directory to initiate the build and launch. Changes you do to the frontend will be reloaded automatically.
6. After that browse to http://localhost:3333 and if all went well, Hangar should be up and running.

### Notes
* The Spring Boot configuration file that is used by this environment is located at `Hangar/src/main/resources/application.yml`
* The fake user settings are located in the application.yml file under `fake-user`.
* Without HangarAuth, you should also disable sso under `use-sso`.

## Hangar Auth (not recommended, complicated, requires like 6 more docker containers)
Fork this project and fork/clone [HangarAuth]. Ensure they are sibling directories in your file system.
```
Projects/
   Hangar/
      ...
   HangarAuth/
      ...
```

### Prerequisites
* Docker is required for all parts of this environment except the frontend
* [pnpm]
### Setting up
To get both Hangar and HangarAuth running locally:
1. Setup HangarAuth
    1. See [HangarAuth README](https://github.com/HangarMC/HangarAuth/blob/master/README.md)
    2. Start HangarAuth's docker services
    3. Create HangarAuth's hydra client
2. Move to Hangar's frontend directory `Hangar/frontend`. In that directory, run `pnpm install` followed by `pnpm run dev`.
3. Set up the hangar client in hydra (see [HangarAuth README](https://github.com/HangarMC/HangarAuth/blob/master/README.md))
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3333 and login.


### Notes
* If using IntelliJ, you can view logs from each service in the Services tab (ALT+8).
* The Spring Boot configuration file that is used by this environment is located at `Hangar/docker/hangar/application.yml`
* This setup requires that the Hangar and [HangarAuth] projects be sibling directories.
* To rebuild changes to Hangar, just rebuild in IntelliJ `CTRL+F9`.
* To rebuild HangarAuth, run `docker-compose up -d --build` in `Hangar/docker`.

## Deployment

Deployment happens via Docker, checkout the stack in the docker folder. The Spring Boot configuration file used for deployment can be found at
`docker/deployment/hangar-backend/application.yml`.

## Translations [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/e/b13e6a1c05002365ee9031712112bd63/localized.svg)](https://hangar.crowdin.com/hangar)

Hangar uses Crowdin for translations. The easiest way to help to translate is sign up to Crowdin at https://hangar.crowdin.com/hangar,
joining the project and just add new translations or comment on or up/down-vote existing translations.  
You can learn more about navigating the Crowdin UI here: https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/

Getting translations locally (mostly for developers, requires crowdin cli, ran in root folder):

`crowdin pull --skip-untranslated-strings -b master -T <PAT>`

You might want to set the env var `TRANSLATION_MODE` to true, in order to get warnings about untranslated strings.

## Contributing

There is a bunch of stuff to do, some of that is noted in the [**Roadmap Project**](https://github.com/PaperMC/Hangar/projects/1).
Your best bet is joining #development on the [Hangar Discord](https://discord.gg/zvrAEbvJ4a) and just discussing with us.
All contributions are very welcome, we will not be able to finish this alone!

Updating the frontend dependencies can be done best by running `npx npm-check -u` and going thru the changelogs. Notice that package.json might contain some hints of which deps are broken.

## License

Most of the frontend is a fork of Ore, licensed under MIT [here](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Ore/blob/staging/LICENSE.txt).
The rest is new code (but created in reference of Ore) and is licensed under the MIT license too.
